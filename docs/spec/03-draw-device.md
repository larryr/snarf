# S-03 — Draw Device Specification (/dev/draw)

Satisfies: R-GFX-01..08, R-OV-05. Decision record: [adr/0003-graphics-dev-draw.md](adr/0003-graphics-dev-draw.md).

## 1. Shape of the device

Follows Plan 9 draw(3):

```
/dev/draw/new              open+read → connection line (client id, display info)
/dev/draw/N/ctl            read display/image info; write control msgs
/dev/draw/N/data           write compiled draw messages; read replies
/dev/draw/N/refresh        blocking read → exposure/resize rectangles
/dev/draw/colormap         legacy; present, constant
/dev/cursor                write 72-byte Plan 9 cursor (or "name <css>") ; empty write resets
```

`read /dev/draw/new` returns the standard 12×12-byte decimal fields: client id, display
image id, channel (`x8r8g8b8`), rect of the display, clip rect. The display rect tracks the
canvas size (CSS pixels × devicePixelRatio, R-GFX-05).

## 2. Message subset (written to `data`)

Byte-compatible with Plan 9's draw protocol; the v1-mandatory verbs (R-GFX-02):

| Verb | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `b id[4] screenid[4] refresh[1] chan[4] repl[1] r[4*4] clipr[4*4] color[4]` | allocate image |
| `f id[4]` | free image |
| `d dstid[4] srcid[4] maskid[4] r[4*4] sp[2*4] mp[2*4]` | general draw (SoverD composite) |
| `r id[4] r[4*4] color[4]` | *(via `d` with repl color images — no separate verb; noted for readers)* |
| `L dstid[4] p0 p1 end0 end1 radius srcid sp` | line |
| `k id[4] n[1] name[n]` / `N ...` | attach/name font & subfont images |
| `l cacheid srcid index r sp left width` | load glyph into font cache |
| `s dstid srcid fontid p r sp n index[2*n]` | draw string from cache |
| `v` | flush: present all changes to the visible display |
| `y id[4] r[4*4] buf[...]` / `Y` | load raw pixels into image (compressed `y` optional v2) |
| `c dstid repl clipr` | set clip |
| `o id[4] r.min[2*4] screenr.min[2*4]` | origin change (window move — used by columns drag) |
| `A id imageid fillid public` / screens | screen alloc — **deferred**: Snarf manages its own window rects client-side in v1; `A` returns error |

Unknown verbs → the write fails with `Rerror "bad draw message"` and the connection notes
the offset (readable from `ctl`) — same debuggability the real devdraw gives.

## 3. Backend: OffscreenCanvas / Canvas2D (R-GFX-03)

The server keeps every allocated image as pixels it owns:

- **Display image & large images**: an `OffscreenCanvas` each (GPU-friendly blits via
  `drawImage`).
- **Small images / masks / fonts**: `ImageData` in WASM-adjacent memory; glyph cache
  subfont strips live as a single canvas atlas per font.
- `d` compositing: `SoverD` maps to `globalCompositeOperation="source-over"` + mask
  handling; the general src/mask/dst case falls back to a software composite in Zig for
  correctness (masks are rare outside fonts; fonts use the atlas path).
- `v` (flush) transfers only dirty rects to the visible canvas
  (`commit`/`transferToImageBitmap` per browser support), then clears the dirty list.

> Revision log: 2026-07-19 — v1 presents via a software-composite canvas backend
> (dev/draw_canvas.zig wraps the golden-verified compositor; one blit per flush).
> The per-image OffscreenCanvas model in this section becomes a later performance
> phase: canvas compositing cannot reproduce the integer-exact CALC11/12 rounding
> the frozen goldens pin (contract R-P5-1).

## 4. Fonts (R-GFX-04)

Plan 9 font/subfont model verbatim: a `.font` file lists ranges → subfont files; subfonts
are images plus glyph metrics, loaded with `i`/`l` messages by the libdraw client (this
spec's §2 table previously listed a fictional `k` verb; the real devdraw font verbs are
`i`/`l`/`s` — 9/port/devdraw.c:1662,1688,1951). v1 ships one embedded bitmap subfont:
the `fixed/unicode.9x18` latin1 subfont (`9x18.0000`, public domain, converted from the
XFree86 misc-fixed BDFs; provenance + license text in `assets/fonts/fixed/README.md`),
stored verbatim in its compressed image(6) form and inflated at font init
(**OQ-GFX-2: resolved** — note the Lucida families are license-encumbered and must never
be embedded). Go Regular + Go Mono remain the target proportional/mono faces for a later
phase, contingent on an offline TTF→subfont pre-conversion tool (run once at import,
never a build dependency). Additional fonts can load from the namespace (e.g.
`/mnt/host/fonts/...`). No browser text APIs are used for editor text (deterministic
metrics; headless tests render identically).

> Revision log: 2026-07-19 — Go-fonts sentence replaced with the misc-fixed v1 ruling
> (phase-3 contract, agents/contracts/phase3-font.md §asset); `k`→`i` verb correction.

## 5. Resize & refresh (R-GFX-05)

Shim observes canvas resize → device updates display rect → writes an exposure rect to
every `refresh` reader. libdraw client's `getwindow()` equivalent re-reads `ctl`, the
editor relays out. `devicePixelRatio` changes are resizes. The refresh file also carries
`visibilitychange` hints so Snarf can stop drawing in hidden tabs.

> Revision log: 2026-09-14 (phase 12c) — the resize half shipped AS SKETCHED, with
> three as-built specifics. (1) The editor path does not read `refresh`: the shim
> pushes `EventKind.resize` (ABI v5), the entry point resizes the backend, calls
> `DevDraw.noteResize`, then `Display.getWindow()` (the `ctl` re-read) and
> `Tree.resize` — contract R-P12c-1. `refresh` is the device-side contract for
> OTHER clients. (2) `refresh` reports ONE rectangle as 16 bytes — `x0 y0 x1 y1`,
> little-endian i32, the rect encoding every other verb in the file uses (G1) —
> not the kernel's 5×4 big-endian `id`+rect record (devdraw.c:1250-1259): our only
> producer is a whole-screen resize of image id 0, so the id field would be a
> constant. It is NON-BLOCKING (nothing pending reads 0 bytes); the kernel's sleep
> on `cl->refrend` (devdraw.c:1237-1248) needs the parked-read machinery that is
> phase 13's work (R-9P-13). (3) `devicePixelRatio` > 1 is NOT yet a resize:
> the backing store is sized in CSS pixels, because the bitmap font has one size
> and a DPR-scaled store would halve the text's physical size on Retina
> (R-P12c-6 — the remaining half of R-GFX-05, needs a 2× font asset).
> `visibilitychange` hints remain unimplemented.

## 6. Performance notes (R-GFX-06)

- All draw messages for one input event are batched into one `data` write; one `v` per
  frame max, driven by `requestAnimationFrame` on the shim side (worker gets a vsync tick).
- Scrolling uses `d` self-copy on the display (blit) + redraw of the exposed band — ACME's
  own strategy; no per-frame allocation in `s`/`d` paths (fixed message buffer).
- Budget: ≤ 1 ms typical for a keystroke redraw at 1080p, leaving frame headroom.

## 7. Headless backend (R-CON-02)

`main_native.zig` links the same devdraw with a plain memory framebuffer backend; tests
assert against golden-image hashes. This is the proof that the core never touched the
browser.
